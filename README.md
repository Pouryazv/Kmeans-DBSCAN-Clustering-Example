# Machine Learning Clustering Algorithms Implementation

This repository contains Jupyter Notebook implementing two popular clustering algorithms, K-means and DBSCAN, developed as an assignment for a university machine learning course. The assignment aims to demonstrate understanding and implementation of these algorithms, along with visualization techniques, for clustering data points based on similarity.

## Introduction

In this project, we implemented K-means and DBSCAN clustering algorithms using Jupyter Notebooks. These notebooks serve as comprehensive guides, providing explanations, code, and visualizations to understand and utilize these algorithms effectively.

## Features

- **K-means**: A partition-based clustering algorithm that aims to partition n data points into K clusters in which each point belongs to the cluster with the nearest mean.
- **DBSCAN (Density-Based Spatial Clustering of Applications with Noise)**: A density-based clustering algorithm that groups together closely packed points while marking outliers as noise.
